## Hello!

![Profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=jashdalal)

I am a Computer Science grad with a love for software development, especially in building fintech and database systems. I have enjoyed my previous roles - from my recent internship at US News in Washington DC, to 2yrs as a software developer at Schlumberger. I'm eager to bring my skills and energy to a full-time role in software development. When I’m not coding, you can find me lost in a good novel, strategizing over a chess board, or out for a bike ride. Let’s connect if any of this interests you - drop me a line at jdalal@umass.edu or on LinkedIn!
